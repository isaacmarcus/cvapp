# Flutter Portfolio WebApp

A Flutter WebApp to showcase my works that has responsive, coherent and intuitive design. Instead of using a template and website/portoflio builder, I thought it would make more sense to showcase my works by creating my own website using flutter. Flutter is a cross-platform development framework developed by google build on the .dart language
